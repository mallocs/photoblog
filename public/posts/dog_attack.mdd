attacked by pit bulls and lessons learned

As I jogged along the dirt path in the dim, gloaming light, I heard a sort of muddled commotion. I curiously scanned the direction it seemed to come from: some bushes, a fence and then a paved road about 30 yards away. Then, a snarling pit bull came into focus charging through the bushes and pushing through the fence. A second pit bull had somehow been stopped by the fence and the owner was frantically but uselessly calling them back. Dogs hate joggers. 

I've run that path probably hundreds of times.
